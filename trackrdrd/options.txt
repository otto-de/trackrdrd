    -n varnish_logfile
        Same as the -n option for varnishd and other Varnish binaries;
        i.e. the 'varnish name' indicating the path of the mmap'd file
        used by varnishd for the shared memory log. By default, the
        host name is assumed (as with varnishd). Also set by the
        config parameter 'varnish.name'. The -n and -f options are
        mutually exclusive.

    -c config_file
        Path of a configuration file. If /etc/trackrdrd.conf exists
        and is readable, then its values are read first. If a file is
        specified by the -c option, then that file is read next, and
        config values that it specifies override values specified in
        /etc/trackrdrd.conf. Finally, config values specified on the
        command line override values specified in any config file. If
        no config files or other command line options are set, default
        config values hold.

    -u user
        Owner of the child process. By default, the child process runs
        as 'nobody'. Also set by the config parameter 'user'.

    -P pid_file
        Path of a file written by the management process that contains
        its process ID. By default, no PID file is written. Also set
        by the config parameter 'pid.file'.

    -l log_file
        Log file for status, warning, debug and error messages. If '-'
        is specified, then log messages are written to stdout. By
        default, syslog(3) is used for logging. Log levels correspond
        to the 'priorities' defined by syslog(3). Also set by the config
        parameter 'log.file'.

    -y syslog_facility
        Set the syslog facility; legal values are 'user' or 'local0'
        through 'local7', and the default is 'local0'. Options -y and
        -l are mutually exclusive. Also set by the config parameter
        'syslog.facility'.

    -D
        Run as a non-demon single process (for testing and
        debugging). By default, trackrdrd runs as a demon with a
        management (parent) process and worker (child) process.

    -f varnishlog_bindump
        A binary dump of the Varnish SHM log produced by 'varnishlog
        -w'. If this option is specified, trackrdrd reads from the
        dump instead of a live SHM log (useful for debugging and
        replaying traffic). The options -f and -n are mutually
        exclusive; -n is the default. Also set by the config parameter
        'varnish.bindump'.

    -d
       Sets the log level to LOG_DEBUG. The default log level is
       LOG_INFO.

    -V
       Print version and exit

    -h
       Print usage and exit
