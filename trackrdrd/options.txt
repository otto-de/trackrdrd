    -n varnish_logfile
        The 'varnish name' indicating the mmap'd log file used by
        varnishd. By default, the host name is assumed (as with
        varnishd).

    -l log_file
        Log file for status, warning, debug and error messages. If '-'
        is specified, then log messages are written to stdout. By
        default, syslog(3) is used for logging. Log levels correspond
        to the 'priorities' defined by syslog(3).

    -f varnishlog_bindump
        A binary dump of the Varnish SHM log produced by 'varnishlog
        -w'. If this option is specified, trackrdrd reads from the
        dump instead of a live SHM log (useful for debugging and
        replaying traffic). The options -f and -n are mutually
        exclusive; -n is the default.

    -d
       Sets the log level to LOG_DEBUG. The default log level is
       LOG_INFO.

    -V
       Print version and exit

    -h
       Print usage and exit
